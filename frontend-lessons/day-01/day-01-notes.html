            <h1>My Heading 1 is the most important.</h1>
            <p>Once upon a time, heading 1 rules the rest of the headings in the html 
            kingdom.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>But my heading 2 is also important, but not as important as h1.</h2>
            <p>Then there was heading 2, who thought to be the fairest of them all, 
            but he cannot compare to what heading 1 could offer.</p>
